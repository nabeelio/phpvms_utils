phpVMS Utility Scripts


These are a set of bash scripts which you can utilize on the command line
to:

  - Setup a new version of phpVMS
  - Upgrade an existing version of phpVMS
  - Upgrade to new betas

You still have to run the /install/install.php (or update.php) files
from your browser, but this takes care of the slowest peice - uploading
all of the files.
