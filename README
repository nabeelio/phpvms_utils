phpVMS Utility Scripts

---

These are a set of bash scripts which you can utilize on the command line
to:

  - Setup a new version of phpVMS
  - Upgrade an existing version of phpVMS
  - Upgrade to new betas

You still have to run the /install/install.php (or update.php) files
from your browser, but this takes care of the slowest peice - uploading
all of the files.

chmod +x ./phpvms_install.sh
./phpvms_install.sh

Note: It requires read/write permissions in the directory it's 
running. It will create a temporary directory to download and
extract the files it needs.

AS A PRECAUTION, MAKE A COPY OF YOUR LOCAL.CONFIG.PHP FILE.
I attempt to make a backup of it (core/local.config.php.1),
I then restore the local.config.php file and remove the .1 file
for security purposes. But JUST IN CASE!! Make a backup.
